# A statistical analysis of pitch distribution in Bach's chorales
## (or how to write a complicated title for a simple project)

This is (what I hope to be) a multi-part project exploring pitch distribution and general musical statistics in J.-S. Bach's choral works. I used [music21](http://web.mit.edu/music21/) to process the scores and pandas/matplotlib for exploring the data.
